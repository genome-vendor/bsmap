release 2.5
1. restore option -r [0,1] to report multiple mapped reads:
    -r 0: only report unique mapped reads
    -r 1: report one random hit if multiple hits has the least number of mismatches
2. set the default number of threads (-p opition) to the number of CPU cores detected (up to 8).  
3. execute sam2bam.sh and samtools in system default path for BAM format output.

01-27-2012
release 2.43
1. fixed a bug in methratio.py

01-19-2012
release 2.42
1. corrected the methylation ratio extraction for overlapping paired hits. (for SAM output only) 
   nucleotides in overlapped part will be counted once instead of twice.

01-11-2012
release 2.4
1. optimized seed patterns, up to 40% faster than v2.3.
2. change -z option from -z <char> to -z <int>, since the zero quality char '!' is a special char in linux shell
    -z @ is now -z 64 (solexa quality)
    -z "!" is now -z 33 (sanger quality), which is the default setting.
3. added -L <int> option to map the first N nucleotides of a read.
4. re-wrote the methratio.py script, much faster and use less memory (~26GB) for
whole genome methylation ratio extraction.  
    changed the syntax of options:
        ref=<ref_file> is changed to -d <ref_file> or --ref=<ref_file>
        chrom=<chr> is changed to -c <chr> or --chr=<chr>
    added options:
        -u, --unique    process only unique mappings
        -p, --pair      process only paired mappings
        -s, --sam-path  set the path to samtools 

12-12-2011
release 2.3
1. added -M <str> option to allow other special alignments instead of C=>T bisulfite
alignment, for example, -M GA could used to detect A=>I editing in RNA-seq.  
2. added -n <int> option to set mapping strand information.  -n 0 only map reads to 2
forward strands, and -n 1 map reads to all 4 possible strands
3. the output reference sequence were expanded by two nucleotide (in lower
cases) to include seqeunce context information. (ie, CG, CHG or CHH)
4. added two options for the methratio.py script.  
	chrom=<chr>	select the chromosomes to process, so that large
	dataset could be broken into chromosomes to use less RAM.
	ref=<ref_file>	specify the reference fasta file when the BSMAP output
	does not include reference sequence.

08-18-2011
release 2.2

05-04-2011

digestion site information in RRBS.

3. fixed a bug in reporting quality chars when the input uses non-sanger quality
4. pair-end module is optimized to be 3 times faster than 1.x version
